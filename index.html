    <h1> Tekst piosenki</h1>
<h1>Bob Dylan - najlepszy muzyk</h1>
<h2>Title: "Lay, lady, lay"</h2>

<p>
    Lay, lady, lay
    Lay across my big brass bed
</p>
<p>
    Lay, lady, lay
    Lay across my big brass bed
</p>
<p>
    Whatever colors you have
    In your mind
</p>
<p>
    I'll show them to you
    And you'll see them shine
</p>
<p>
    Lay, lady, lay
    Lay across my big brass bed
    Stay, lady, stay
    Stay with your man awhile
</p>
<p>
    Until the break of day
    Let me see you make him smile
</p>
<p>
    His clothes are dirty, but his-
    His hands are clean
    And you're the best thing that he's
    Ever seen
</p>
<p>
    Stay, lady, stay
    Stay with your man awhile
</p>
